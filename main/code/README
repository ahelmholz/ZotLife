-loaders load/parse .maj file
-builders build possbile schedules according to parameters in runtime_vars
-main is ran by caller
-right now main uses hard coded values for parameters and randomly generates the likelyhoods
    of a course being offered in order to test the framework 
-.maj file under UCI for SOCIOLOGY is used for testing and debug flag is on
-the SOCIOLOGY .maj file is the only available input file for now
    - new input files can be formed for the framework using the specification/syntax
      shown in main/universities/SSU/majors/major.BS.16-17
-pseudo_code_scribbles contains a messy/rough overview of how the schedule building
 algorithm in builders works
